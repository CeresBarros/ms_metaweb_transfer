  abstract = {It has been suggested that differences in body size between consumer and resource species may have important implications for interaction strengths, population dynamics, and eventually food web structure, function, and evolution. Still, the general distribution of consumer–resource body-size ratios in real ecosystems, and whether they vary systematically among habitats or broad taxonomic groups, is poorly understood. Using a unique global database on consumer and resource body sizes, we show that the mean body-size ratios of aquatic herbivorous and detritivorous consumers are several orders of magnitude larger than those of carnivorous predators. Carnivorous predator–prey body-size ratios vary across different habitats and predator and prey types (invertebrates, ectotherm, and endotherm vertebrates). Predator–prey body-size ratios are on average significantly higher (1) in freshwater habitats than in marine or terrestrial habitats, (2) for vertebrate than for invertebrate predators, and (3) for invertebrate than for ectotherm vertebrate prey. If recent studies that relate body-size ratios to interaction strengths are general, our results suggest that mean consumer–resource interaction strengths may vary systematically across different habitat categories and consumer types.},

  abstract = {Increasing evidence suggests that an appropriate model for food webs, the network of feeding links in a community of species, should take into account the inherent variability of ecological interactions. Harnessing this variability, we will show that it is useful to interpret empirically observed food webs as realisations of a family of stochastic processes, namely random dot-product graph models. These models provide an ideal extension of food-web models beyond the limitations of current deterministic or partially probabilistic models. As an additional benefit, our RDPG framework enables us to identify the pairwise distance structure given by species' functional food-web traits: this allows for the natural emergence of ecologically meaningful species groups. Lastly, our results suggest the notion that the evolutionary signature in food webs is already detectable in their stochastic backbones, while the contribution of their fine wiring is arguable. Synthesis Food webs are influenced by many stochastic processes and are constantly evolving. Here, we treat observed food webs as realisations of random dot-product graph models (RDPG), extending food-web modelling beyond the limitations of current deterministic or partially probabilistic models. Our RDPG framework enables us to identify the pairwise-distance structure given by species' functional food-web traits, which in turn allows for the natural emergence of ecologically meaningful species groups. It also provides a way to measure the phylogenetic signal present in food webs, which we find is strongest in webs' low-dimensional backbones.},

Yet biodiversity is more than a collection of individual species; it is the combination of biological entities and processes that support life on Earth. To understand biodiversity we must catalog it, but we must also assess the ways species interact with other species to provide functional support for the Tree of Life. Ecological interactions may be lost well before the species involved in those interactions go extinct; their ecological functions disappear even though they remain. Here, I address the challenges in studying the functional aspects of species interactions and how basic research is helping us address the fast-paced extinction of species due to human activities.},

  abstract = {Motivation Documenting potential interactions between species represents a major step to understand and predict the spatial and temporal structure of multi-trophic communities and their functioning. The metaweb concept summarises the potential trophic (and non-trophic) interactions in a given species-pool. As such, it generalises the regional species-pool of community ecology by incorporating the potential relationships between species from different trophic levels along with their functional characteristics. However, while this concept is theoretically very attractive, it has rarely been used to understand the structure of ecological network, mostly because of data availability. Here, we provide a continental scale, species-level, metaweb for all tetrapods (mammals, breeding birds, reptiles, amphibians) occurring in Europe and in the Northern Mediterranean basin. This metaweb is based on data extracted from scientific literature, including published papers, books, and grey literature. Main type of variable contained For each species considered, we built the network of potential 2-way trophic interactions. Spatial location and grain We considered all species occurring in the entire European sub-continent, from Macaronesia (including only the islands politically belonging to Spain and Portugal) to the Ural Mountains (west to east), and from Fennoscandia and UK islands to the Mediterranean (north to south). We included Turkey, geographically part of Asia, to provide a complete picture of the north-eastern Mediterranean coast. Time period The data represent information published and/or collected during the last 50 years. Major taxa studied and level of measurement We focused our metaweb on terrestrial tetrapods occurring in the study area. Only species introduced in historical times and currently naturalized were considered; novel introductions were excluded. In total we included 288 mammals, 509 regularly breeding birds, 250 reptiles, and 104 amphibians. Software format Data are supplied as semi-colon separated text files.},

To reconcile these contrasting observations, we postulate the existence of a backbone of interactions underlying all ecological networks—a common substructure within every network comprised of species playing similar ecological roles—and a periphery of species whose idiosyncrasies help explain the differences between networks. To test this conjecture, we introduce a new approach to investigate the structural similarity of 411 food webs from multiple environments and biomes. We first find significant differences in the way species in different ecosystems interact with each other. Despite these differences, we then show that there is compelling evidence of a common backbone of interactions underpinning all food webs. We expect that identifying a backbone of interactions will shed light on the rules driving assembly of different ecological communities.},

The integration of biogeography and network theory will yield important results and further our understanding of species interactions. It has, however, been hampered so far by the difficulty to quantify variation among interaction networks. Here, we propose a general framework to study the dissimilarity of species interaction networks over time, space or environments, allowing both the use of quantitative and qualitative data. We decompose network dissimilarity into interactions and species turnover components, so that it is immediately comparable to common measures of β-diversity. We emphasise that scaling up β-diversity of community composition to the β-diversity of interactions requires only a small methodological step, which we foresee will help empiricists adopt this method. We illustrate the framework with a large dataset of hosts and parasites interactions and highlight other possible usages. We discuss a research agenda towards a biogeographical theory of species interactions.},

  abstract = {Abstract           Collecting network interaction data is difficult. Non-exhaustive sampling and complex hidden processes often result in an incomplete data set. Thus, identifying potentially present but unobserved interactions is crucial both in understanding the structure of large scale data, and in predicting how previously unseen elements will interact. Recent studies in network analysis have shown that accounting for metadata (such as node attributes) can improve both our understanding of how nodes interact with one another, and the accuracy of link prediction. However, the dimension of the object we need to learn to predict interactions in a network grows quickly with the number of nodes. Therefore, it becomes computationally and conceptually challenging for large networks. Here, we present a new predictive procedure combining a graph embedding method with machine learning techniques to predict interactions on the base of nodes’ metadata. Graph embedding methods project the nodes of a network onto a—low dimensional—latent feature space. The position of the nodes in the latent feature space can then be used to predict interactions between nodes. Learning a mapping of the nodes’ metadata to their position in a latent feature space corresponds to a classic—and low dimensional—machine learning problem. In our current study we used the Random Dot Product Graph model to estimate the embedding of an observed network, and we tested different neural networks architectures to predict the position of nodes in the latent feature space. Flexible machine learning techniques to map the nodes onto their latent positions allow to account for multivariate and possibly complex nodes’ meta-data. To illustrate the utility of the proposed procedure, we apply it to a large dataset of tourist visits to destinations across New Zealand. We found that our procedure accurately predicts interactions for both existing nodes and nodes newly added to the network, while being computationally feasible even for very large networks. Overall, our study highlights that by exploiting the properties of a well understood statistical model for complex networks and combining it with standard machine learning techniques, we can simplify the link prediction problem when incorporating multivariate node metadata. Our procedure can be immediately applied to different types of networks, and to a wide variety of data from different systems. As such, both from a network science and data science perspective, our work offers a flexible and generalisable procedure for link prediction.},

They frequently arise through co-evolutionary processes, which match the traits of both partners, facilitating their interaction. Insights in these interaction mechanisms are vital to be able to manage changing ecosystems. This entails the need for models to predict species interaction networks in general and pollination networks in particular. We show how kernel-based pairwise learning can predict bee–plant interactions based on the traits and the phylogeny of the plant and bee species. The traits and the phylogeny of the plant and bee species proved to be highly predictive. Although the traits were slightly more informative compared to the phylogeny, the best results were obtained by combining both the traits and the phylogeny in the model Notably, the model performance varied greatly depending on whether the goal was to pinpoint missing interactions in the network or to predict interactions for new bee species, new plant species, or both. This issue highlights the importance of proper stratification when fitting biological network prediction models. Our model, however, showed the capacity to generalize beyond the original dataset provided by FlorAbeilles. The model was validated by predicting potentially interacting plant species for the invasive bee species Megachile sculpturalis. Four out of the five plant species identified by the model could be validated based on literature.},

  abstract = {The island of Newfoundland is unique because it has as many non-native terrestrial mammals as native ones. The impacts of non-native species on native flora and fauna can be profound and invasive species have been identified as one of the primary drivers of species extinction. Few studies, however, have investigated the effects of a non-native species assemblage on community and ecosystem properties. We reviewed the literature to build the first terrestrial mammal food web for the island of Newfoundland and then used network analyses to investigate how the timing of introductions and trophic position of non-native species has affected the structure of the terrestrial mammal food web in Newfoundland. The first non-native mammals (house mouse and brown rat) became established in Newfoundland with human settlement in the late 15th and early 16th centuries. Coyotes and southern red-backed voles are the most recent mammals to establish themselves on the island in 1985 and 1998, respectively. The fraction of intermediate species increased with the addition of non-native mammals over time whereas the fraction of basal and top species declined over time. This increase in intermediate species mediated by non-native species arrivals led to an overall increase in the terrestrial mammal food web connectance and generality (i.e. mean number of prey per predator). This diverse prey base and sources of carrion may have facilitated the natural establishment of coyotes on the island. Also, there is some evidence that the introduction of non-native prey species such as the southern red-backed vole has contributed to the recovery of the threatened American marten. Long-term monitoring of the food web is required to understand and predict the impacts of the diverse novel interactions that are developing in the terrestrial mammal food web of Newfoundland.},

These definitions ignore the notion of 'physical complexity', which can measure the amount of information contained in an ecological network, and how difficult it would be to compress. We present relative rank deficiency and SVD entropy as measures of 'external' and 'internal' complexity respectively. Using bipartite ecological networks, we find that they all show a very high, almost maximal, physical complexity. Pollination networks, in particular, are more complex when compared to other types of interactions. In addition, we find that SVD entropy relates to other structural measures of complexity (nestedness, connectance, and spectral radius), but does not inform about the resilience of a network when using simulated extinction cascades, which has previously been reported for structural measures of complexity. We argue that SVD entropy provides a fundamentally more 'correct' measure of network complexity and should be added to the toolkit of descriptors of ecological networks moving forward.},

  abstract = {Big, time-scaled phylogenies are fundamental to connecting evolutionary processes to modern biodiversity patterns. Yet inferring reliable phylogenetic trees for thousands of species involves numerous trade-offs that have limited their utility to comparative biologists. To establish a robust evolutionary timescale for all approximately 6,000 living species of mammals, we developed credible sets of trees that capture root-to-tip uncertainty in topology and divergence times. Our “backbone-and-patch” approach to tree building applies a newly assembled 31-gene supermatrix to two levels of Bayesian inference: (1) backbone relationships and ages among major lineages, using fossil node or tip dating, and (2) species-level “patch” phylogenies with nonoverlapping in-groups that each correspond to one representative lineage in the backbone. Species unsampled for DNA are either excluded (“DNA-only” trees) or imputed within taxonomic constraints using branch lengths drawn from local birth–death models (“completed” trees). Joining time-scaled patches to backbones results in species-level trees of extant Mammalia with all branches estimated under the same modeling framework, thereby facilitating rate comparisons among lineages as disparate as marsupials and placentals. We compare our phylogenetic trees to previous estimates of mammal-wide phylogeny and divergence times, finding that (1) node ages are broadly concordant among studies, and (2) recent (tip-level) rates of speciation are estimated more accurately in our study than in previous “supertree” approaches, in which unresolved nodes led to branch-length artifacts. Credible sets of mammalian phylogenetic history are now available for download at http://vertlife.org/phylosubsets, enabling investigations of long-standing questions in comparative biology.},

  abstract = {Most dimension reduction techniques produce ordered coordinates so that only the first few coordinates need be considered in subsequent analyses. The choice of how many coordinates to use is often made with a visual heuristic, i.e., by making a scree plot and looking for a “big gap” or an “elbow.” In this article, we present a simple and automatic procedure to accomplish this goal by maximizing a simple profile likelihood function. We give a wide variety of both simulated and real examples.},
